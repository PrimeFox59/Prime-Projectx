# Copilot Instructions

- Project: Flask + SQLite web app "Prime Projectx" with dark, techy landing page and QR-based quotation viewer.
- Keep code clear, concise, and ASCII-only unless existing files require otherwise.
- Prefer Flask blueprints only if the app grows; for now a single file app.py is fine.
- Use templates + static assets (CSS/JS) for UI; avoid inline CSS where possible.
- Requirements tracked in requirements.txt; keep README updated with setup/run steps.
- Do not remove user data or existing changes without explicit request.
